		<p>Here are some of the web apps that I have created; some are for study purposes and others have been buit for clients.</p>

			<a href="https://jobs-log.herokuapp.com/"><h4>Jobs Log</h></h4></a>
			<p>This was created for a member of the Audio Visual department within a corperate establishment.  After each job they complete, it is recored in their spreadsheet on their laptop.  The client asked for a way to record a job, but without the need to access their laptop.</p><p>
			The parameters are alraedy set, so all the user needs to do is enter the data & press enter; once that happens the information is stored in a (PostgreSQL) database, then reloaded back onto the page for the user to see. I have created a reports page where the user can run a report for the different type of jobs, and the different type of outcomes (if completed or not ect).  This puts the user at a variable position when they can access & update their table at anytime, with the use of a smartphone or device.  As I deepen my skillset I will apply it to this app, making it a little more intricate as I progress.</p>

			<P>EasyCHEF is a simple app that allows the user to recieve a random recipe by supplying the app with ingredients.  This app is testing the way I communicate with API's in order to retrieve information.</P><p>EasyCHEF! will be developed upon as I experiement & increase my skills.</p>
