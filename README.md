SINCLAIR AKOTO PORTFOLIO

This is my online portfolio where users can view my skillset by previewing & interacting with my created pages.

My CV is also interactive and a feedback form will be present to conduct research on my portfolio.

Data will be stored with SQL.

This portfolio will be constatly under construction as I will plan to apply new skills learned and also update my portfolio with newly created apps.

The OFFLINE folder is my development folder until my app is ready for production.
